<p>Chemistry has always been my passion. I have dabbled in many branches of chemistry and liked them all! I have a Masters in Organic Chemistry from University of Calcutta, one of the oldest Universities in India. My Ph.D is in Bio-analytical Chemistry, during which I build microfluidic devices for trapping single cancer cells for analysis of single cell analyte. This would be a break through in early disease diagnosis of the deadly disease. If you are keen to know more, please keep on reading at the end <a href="Research Part 1.html" id="research1">Research Part A</a>
<a href="Research Part 2.html" id="research2">Research Part B</a>
Enjoy the movies which shows the single cancer cell trapping in real time.

I have worked as an Analytical Chemist at a pharmaceutical company and developed <strong>UHPLC</strong> method for separating and quantifying water and fat soluble vitamins. It was a pretty cool job. But I wanted to do more. So I joined Intel as a Process Engineer and my job role is that of the Chemical Engineer of the group. We are involved in chemical vapor deposition of dielectric thin films to form the <q>Fins</q> of the FINFETS. I cannot talk about the actual process, as it is Intellectual Property but can guide to some very cool articles about the process in general(UPON REQUEST ONLY!).
